    <h2>Details</h2>
    <p>A  National Mission for Financial Inclusion (NMFI), namely, Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana (PMJDY) was launched across the Country  in August, 2014 by the Prime Minister with the idea to ensure that citizens envisage their financial activities. PMJDY provides universal banking services for every unbanked household, based on the guiding principles of banking the unbanked, securing the unsecured, funding the unfunded and serving unserved and underserved areas. In order to give impetus to financial inclusion initiatives of the Government, PMJDY scheme was extended beyond 14.08.2018 with the focus on opening of accounts shifting from “every household” to “every unbanked adult”. </p>

    <p>The scheme has been made more attractive with upward revision in </p>
    <ul>
    <li>&#x2022; OD limit from Rs. 5,000/- to Rs. 10,000/- and </li>
    <li>&#x2022; Accidental  insurance cover on RuPay card holders from Rs.1 lakh to Rs.2 lakhs. </li>
</ul>
    <p>PMJDY has been successful in increasing banking penetration and promoting financial inclusion across the country. The scheme has ensured access to various financial services like availability of basic savings bank account, access to need based credit, remittances facility, insurance and pension to the excluded sections i.e. weaker sections & low-income groups.</p>

<h2>Benefits</h2>
<p><strong>Basic Savings Bank Deposit Account (BSBDA)</strong></p>
<p>Any Indian citizen eligible to open a regular bank account can open a BSBDA. Such an account does not require any minimum balance maintenance. The account holders can use both bank branches, ATMs and Banking Correspondents (BCs) for depositing and withdrawing cash. However, one cannot withdraw cash more than four times a month.</p>
  
<p><strong>Small Account/Chota Khata</strong></p>
<p>Under Jan Dhan Yojana, people can open small bank accounts without presenting legal documents. These accounts would be valid normally for a period of twelve months. Thereafter, such accounts  would be allowed to a continue for a further period of twelve more months, if the account-holder provides a document showing that he/she has applied for any of the Officially Valid Document, within 12 months of opening the small account.</p>

<p><strong>RuPay Debit Card with inbuilt accident insurance</strong></p>
<p>Under PMJDY,  a free Rupay debit card,  with inbuilt accident insurance cover of Rs.2 lakhs (Rs 1 lakh for accounts opened before 28.08.2018),  is issued to all beneficiaries. </p>

<p><strong>Overdraft Facility</strong></p>
<p>Under PMJDY, beneficiaries can avail OD facility upto Rs. 10,000/-.</p>
